ANIMATION BUG: sometimes flippedPieces are drawn in their old color.
- Board.Animation.value becomes 0 when changing Portrait/Landscape
    - could just clear flippedPieces on changing Portrait/Landscape
    - BoardState.initState() gets called when changing Portrait/Landscape
    - rewrite using https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedWidget-class.html?
    - can move animation to Game?
- show Legal Moves only after Animation Completed?

CustomOrientationBuilder
- pass real uiWidth & uiHeight

ComputerPlayer
- Opponent widget
    - port other Levels
    - DropdownButtons under Score
    - handle 2 ComputerPlayers

Android
- handle Navigate Back for Undo?
    - probably won't work in Browser
